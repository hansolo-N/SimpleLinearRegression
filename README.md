## Objective
The objective of this project is to build a linear regression model to predict salary based on work experience.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Import the dataset.
   - Check for missing values and handle them if necessary.
   - Perform any necessary data transformations or feature scaling.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualize the relationship between work experience and salary.
   - Check for any outliers or anomalies in the data.
   - Explore any other relevant insights from the data.

3. **Model Building**:
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Build a simple linear regression model using the training data.
   - Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., mean squared error, R-squared).

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Assess the model's performance on the testing set.
   - Visualize the model's predictions versus the actual values.
   - Interpret the model coefficients and any other relevant insights.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Summarize the findings of the project.
   - Discuss any limitations of the model and areas for further improvement.
